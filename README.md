# NAVEE - An English learning website for visually impaired student (Frontend)
-------------------------
## We are still on our developing progress
-------------------------
## How to run the code
1. Clone this repository and navee_backend repository (also on my account) for full experience
2. Run "npm install" (at first time)
3. Run "npm run start" (for the developing environment)
-------------------------
## Features
The website includes features for students and teachers (also admin - just temporary, we are thinking to separate these 2 roles)
For students, they can learn all the free courses through the website, note the vocabularies to the flashcard, take the tests. We are on the way to train an AI model helps recognize voices and do the pronunciation assessment.
For teachers, they can upload, edit or delete courses, tests, vocabs and flashcards (students are also able to create their own flashcards too)
